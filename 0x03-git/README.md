I created a new directory named 0x03-git inside my alx-zero_day repo
Inside this new directory, I created subdirectories (bash, c and js)
And inside each one of them, I created files. Although, only the bash directory has texts in it.
I enventually deleted js directory and its content and I updated the bash text files.
